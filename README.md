Number Classification API

Description

This API is designed to classify numbers into predefined categories based on certain criteria. The application uses a machine learning model or simple algorithm to process numbers and return a classification result.

This repository contains the backend for the number classification system, built using Flask. The API exposes endpoints that can receive a number as input and return a classification response.

Features

Simple number classification: Classify numbers based on user-defined logic.
REST API: Exposes endpoints to interact with the classification system via HTTP requests.
Python-based backend: Built with Python and Flask.
Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before running the application:

Python 3.7+
Pip (Python package installer)
Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
You can check your Python version by running:

python3 --version
Installation

Clone the repository:
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-classification-api.git
cd number-classification-api
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
You can set up a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate it:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:
Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt, you can manually install the dependencies:

pip install flask requests
Install six (if needed):
If you encounter an error related to six, you can install it manually:

pip install six
Start the Flask application:
Once the installation is complete, you can run the Flask application:

python3 app.py
This will start the API server on http://localhost:5000.
Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API via HTTP requests.

Endpoints
POST /classify
Classify a number into a specific category based on the criteria defined in your model or algorithm.

Request body (JSON):

{
  "number": 42
}
Response (JSON):

{
  "classification": "even"
}
Possible Responses:

200 OK if the request is successful and the number is classified.
400 Bad Request if the request body is invalid.
Example using curl:
To classify the number 42, you can send a POST request like this:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/classify -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"number": 42}'
This should return a classification result.

Example using Python requests:
import requests

data = {"number": 42}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/classify", json=data)

print(response.json())
Testing

You can run tests for the API by using a testing framework like pytest. Make sure your API is running, and then run:

pytest tests/
Ensure you have a test suite set up with appropriate test cases for your endpoints.
